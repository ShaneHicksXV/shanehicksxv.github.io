      <h2>Purpose of a New Substation?</h2>
      <p>
        West Texas has experienced significant growth in both energy production and demand.
        A new substation helps tie new resources into the grid while maintaining safe and reliable power
        for local communities.

      <h2>Project Phases</h2>
      <p>
        The project follows a series of phases, including conceptual design, permitting,
        site preparation, equipment installation, and final testing before energization.
        Each phase is planned with safety and quality in mind.

      <h2>Community and Stakeholders</h2>
      <p>
        Although this project is conceptual, real substation projects involve close
        coordination with landowners, local communities, utilities, and regulators.
        Transparent communication and early engagement help address questions and concerns.
