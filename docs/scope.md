# Project Scope Statement

**Project Title:** West Texas Substation Construction Project  
**Project Manager:** Shane Hicks  
**Date:** February 2026  
**Location:** West Texas 

---

## Purpose and Justification

The purpose of this project is to plan and communicate the construction of a new high-voltage electrical substation in West Texas to support regional load growth, renewable energy integration, and grid reliability. The website and documentation serve as a simplified representation of how such a project could be scoped, planned, and communicated to stakeholders.

This project is educational and conceptual, but it models realistic constraints, risks, and communication needs associated with substation construction.

## Objectives

1. Define a clear scope for a new greenfield substation project in West Texas.
2. Produce a concise project plan including schedule structure and risk analysis.
3. Deliver a simple, two-page public website that:
   - Explains the project purpose and benefits.
   - Summarizes schedule phases and high-level impacts.
4. Demonstrate basic project management artifacts (scope, plan, retrospective) in a single repository.

## High-Level Requirements

- New 138 kV–34.5 kV substation (conceptual rating) connecting to existing transmission infrastructure.
- Basic site preparation, foundations, steel structures, bus work, power transformer(s), breakers, disconnect switches, control house, and protection & control systems.
- Compliance with applicable safety, environmental, and utility standards.
- Coordination with local utilities, landowners, and regulatory agencies.
- Public-facing information available through a simple website.

*(Technical details are simplified for educational purposes.)*

## Deliverables

**Technical (conceptual) Deliverables:**

- Defined conceptual substation scope and assumptions.
- High-level schedule (phases + key tasks) and risk register overview.

**Course/Repository Deliverables:**

- `index.html` – Project overview for public stakeholders.
- `about.html` – Additional technical and contextual background.
- `style.css` – Shared styling to maintain a professional look.
- `docs/scope.md` – This scope statement.
- `docs/plan.md` – Project plan, TAME risk analysis, and Work Breakdown Structure.
- `docs/retrospective.md` – Reflection on process what went well, what went wrong, what to change.

---

## Assumptions

- Land rights and basic permitting can be secured within the planned timeframe.
- Interconnection to existing transmission lines is technically feasible at the chosen point.
- No major environmental showstoppers are discovered (e.g., endangered habitat that blocks construction).
- Necessary equipment (transformers, breakers, steel) is available within standard lead times.
- Budget and basic regulatory approvals are in place at a high level for this conceptual project.

---

## Constraints

- Educational project: detailed engineering and real-world costs are out of scope.
- Website limited to static HTML and CSS.
- Timeline simplified into a few major phases (not a full detailed CPM schedule).
- Documentation must fit within the format and file set required by the course.

---

## In-Scope

- Conceptual description of a new substation in West Texas.
- High-level schedule and risk analysis.
- Public-facing communication via a simple website.
- Reflection on process and lessons learned.

## Out-of-Scope

- Detailed engineering drawings or protection & control schematics.
- Actual cost estimates or procurement contracts.
- Real regulatory filings or land acquisition documentation.
- Construction means and methods beyond a conceptual description.

---

## Success Criteria

- All required repository elements are present and clearly organized.
- Website:
  - Loads correctly on desktop and mobile.
  - Links between `index.html` and `about.html` function.
  - Presents a clear explanation of the project purpose and benefits.
- Documentation:
  - Scope, plan, and retrospective are consistent with each other.
  - Risks and schedule are realistic at a high level for a substation project.
