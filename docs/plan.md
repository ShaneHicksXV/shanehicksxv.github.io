# Project Plan - West Texas Substation

**Project Title:** West Texas Substation Construction Project  
**Project Manager:** Shane Hicks  
**Date:** February 2026  

---

## Approach

This project follows a simplified hybrid approach, combining structured planning with iterative refinement of documentation and website content. The focus is on clarity, stakeholder communication, and risk awareness rather than exhaustive technical detail.

## Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Schedule

The schedule is conceptual, grouped into five major phases. Each phase can align roughly with weeks or months depending on the level of realism you want to assume.

### Level 1: Major Phases

1. Initiation & Concept
2. Planning & Design
3. Site Preparation & Civil Works
4. Electrical Installation & Commissioning
5. Closeout & Handover

### Level 2: Tasks by Phase

**1. Initiation & Concept**
- 1.1 Define project need (load growth, reliability, renewables integration).
- 1.2 Identify conceptual site and transmission interconnection point.
- 1.3 Outline stakeholder groups (utility, landowners, community, regulators).
- 1.4 Approve conceptual go/no-go at a high level.

**2. Planning & Design**
- 2.1 Preliminary engineering (one-line diagram, conceptual layout).
- 2.2 Environmental and permitting studies (conceptual level).
- 2.3 Stakeholder engagement plan (public meetings, website content).
- 2.4 Schedule and budget at conceptual level.
- 2.5 Risk assessment and mitigation strategies.

**3. Site Preparation & Civil Works**
- 3.1 Site survey and geotechnical investigations.
- 3.2 Grading, drainage, and access roads.
- 3.3 Foundations for transformers, breakers, structures, and control house.
- 3.4 Perimeter fencing and grounding grid.

**4. Electrical Installation & Commissioning**
- 4.1 Steel structures and bus work installation.
- 4.2 Equipment installation (transformers, breakers, switches, CTs/PTs).
- 4.3 Control house, panels, wiring, and communication.
- 4.4 Protection & control relay testing.
- 4.5 Energization and performance verification.

**5. Closeout & Handover**
- 5.1 Punch list completion and quality documentation.
- 5.2 As-built drawings and records.
- 5.3 Training for operations staff.
- 5.4 Final handover and project closure review.

## TAME Risk Analysis

TAME = Technical, Administrative, Market (or stakeholder/acceptance), External.

### Technical Risks

- **T1: Design or equipment compatibility issues**
  - *Description:* Protection schemes or equipment ratings may not fully align with existing grid requirements.
  - *Mitigation:* Early coordination with utility standards; peer review of conceptual design.

- **T2: Construction quality or safety issues**
  - *Description:* High-voltage work always carries safety risk.
  - *Mitigation:* Enforce strict safety procedures; qualified contractors; regular QA/QC inspections.

### Administrative Risks

- **A1: Scope creep**
  - *Description:* Adding extra bays, feeders, or features mid-project.
  - *Mitigation:* Define clear scope baseline; change control process; evaluate impact before approval.

- **A2: Schedule slippage**
  - *Description:* Delays in design, permitting, or construction.
  - *Mitigation:* Build float into schedule; early permitting start; regular schedule reviews.

### Market / Stakeholder Risks

- **M1: Community opposition**
  - *Description:* Local residents concerned about visual impact, noise, or EMF.
  - *Mitigation:* Transparent communication, public meetings, informative website, visual screening where feasible.

- **M2: Utility or customer demand changes**
  - *Description:* Load forecasts change, reducing or increasing need.
  - *Mitigation:* Use conservative planning assumptions; keep design adaptable for future expansion.

### External Risks

- **E1: Extreme weather events**
  - *Description:* West Texas weather (heat, storms, high winds) may impact construction.
  - *Mitigation:* Schedule critical outdoor work during favorable seasons; design for local weather conditions.

- **E2: Supply chain disruptions**
  - *Description:* Long lead times for transformers and breakers.
  - *Mitigation:* Early procurement; consider alternate suppliers; maintain communication with vendors.

## Stakeholders

- **Transmission/Utility Owner:** Sponsors and operates the substation.
- **Regional System Operator (e.g., ERCOT equivalent in concept):** Ensures grid reliability and approves interconnection.
- **Local Community & Landowners:** Affected by construction, visuals, and access.
- **Regulators & Authorities Having Jurisdiction:** Oversee permits, safety, and environmental compliance.
- **Construction Contractors & Engineering Firms:** Perform design and build work.

---

## Communications Plan (Simplified)

- **Internal Project Team:** Weekly coordination meetings; shared schedule and risk log.
- **Utility / Owner Leadership:** Monthly high-level updates.
- **Community & Public:** Dedicated information webpage (this website), plus potential open house / Q&A.
- **Regulatory Agencies:** As required by permitting milestones.
