# Project Retrospective

**Project Title:** West Texas Substation Construction Project  
**Project Manager:** Shane Hicks 
**Date:** February 2026  

## What Went Well

- **Clear Scope:** Defining the project as a conceptual greenfield substation in West Texas made it easier to keep the website and documents focused and realistic without getting lost in engineering details.
- **Consistent Artifacts:** The scope, plan, and website content align well with each other, giving a coherent story from initiation through closeout.
- **Simple, Readable Website:** Using a shared stylesheet for both pages produced a clean, consistent visual identity that supports the professional tone of the project.

## What Went Wrong

- **Time Estimation:** Writing the documentation took longer than expected, especially balancing technical accuracy with simplicity.
- **Detail Creep:** It was tempting to add many more technical details, specific equipment ratings, one-line diagrams, which could have overwhelmed the educational purpose of the project.
- **Mobile Layout Tweaks:** Minor adjustments to spacing and font sizes were needed after testing the site on smaller screens.

## What I Would Do Differently

- **Plan Content Earlier:** Next time, I would outline the website sections and documentation headings together from the start, so the content flows naturally across all artifacts.
- **Add Visual Aids:** Even in a simple static site, a conceptual diagram or timeline graphic would make the substation project easier to understand for non-technical stakeholders.
- **Deeper Stakeholder Emphasis:** I would expand the communication plan to include example FAQs or community concerns, reflecting how infrastructure projects actually engage the public.
